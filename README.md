## 🧩 How It Works

The game board is a 3x3 grid. Players take turns to input their move by selecting a number from 1 to 9 corresponding to the board positions:

```
 1 | 2 | 3
-----------
 4 | 5 | 6
-----------
 7 | 8 | 9
```

* Player 1 uses **X**
* Player 2 uses **O**
* First player to align 3 of their symbols (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins.
